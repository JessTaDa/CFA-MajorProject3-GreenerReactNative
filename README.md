#  Greener - CFA Major Project 3 - React Native component

### Problem Definition

Waste is a growing problem in Australia. In recent years, we have seen waste in Australia increasing more than 8% each year. Tackling wasted disposable coffee cups is one small way of tackling this issue.

Roughly 40% of café revenue is through take away coffee. Less than 5% of takeaway coffee is served in reusable cups. Australians go through more than a billion disposable coffee cups a year. If these were lined up, it could circumnavigate the earth 2.5 times.

To incentivise the use of reusable cups, some cafes in Sydney currently offer a discount to customers who bring their own cups. These discounts differ from store to store and many cafes run this at a loss. There is currently easy no system to track how many customers bring reusable cups and hence, no accurate data to back this cause.

### Solution

The solution is to build mobile app in react native that allows customers to scan a QR code each time they purchase a coffee using a reusable cup. Each café will have their unique QR code.  Each time a QR code is scanned, information will be transmitted to the database, which will keep records of how many reusable cups were used at each café.

As the customer is doing the scanning with their smartphones, cafes who wish to sign up to the program are not required invest in any scanning technologies or required to have any input counter system to keep track of reusable cups.

With enough data collected, we will be able to gain a better understanding of customer behaviour around reusable cups. What percentage of customers bring their own cups? How many disposable cups are cafes saving by offering the discount? Do they make this money back as well as contribute positively to a less waste Australia?

### Budgeting, scheduling & planning:
Trello was used throughout the project for brainstorming and grooming. Userstories were catagorised into cards and assigned as an MVP feature or future feature. Trello was also used to keep track of progress throughout project implementation.

# Client interaction
It is important to ensure the app built would solve the client's problem effectively. To ensure the project was on track to do this, consistent clear communication with the client is paramount. A client interaction diary was kept throughout the course of this project, noting down all accounts of interaction. As well, client confirmation was saught before the project obtained go-ahead status.

Emailed city of Sydney as this was where I saw the list of Sydney cafes offering a discount for reusable cups. This is where I got the idea from.

Received email from Megan, Sustainability Engagement Officer, City of Sydney. Megan forwarded me to an organisation called ‘Responsible Cafes’. Messaged ‘Responsible Cafes’ on their facebook page as well as sent them an email. In the message I introduced myself, my project and requested to catch up over coffee.

Met with Justin from Responsible Cafes. Told Justin that I was interested in this movement and offered to help build something for two weeks. Made it clear my timeline for this project was just two weeks and that whatever solution I build will have to be achieved within this time. Justin was happy that I approached him and told me about some of the issues and challenges they were facing. I would think about it and get back to him on some ideas.

Came up with react-native QR code scanning app in class with the help of some classmates. Emailed Justin this and asked him about his thoughts on it.

>(04/06/2017)
Still unable to reach Justin. He said he will give me a call back.

>(06/06/2017)
Spoke to Justin over the phone. He apologises for being super busy and is attending a conference in Melbourne. Will have no time to catch-up before the project due date. I explained the app idea, the scope and stage of the project I was likely to get to by Friday. He was happy with it and was happy for me to formalize this over email.

>(07/06/2017)
Sent Justin my official project scope and he accepted it over email
